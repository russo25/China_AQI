Chinas Air Quality and Economic Data
Where is the best location to establish a buisness?


Notional analysis of establishing a business in China with considerations of Air Quality (primarily) and other factors.

This project explores available Ar Quality data from China and several other business and quality of life (QOL) considerations in establishing a business in China.  The major questions include:

1. Where is the best location for air quality, available workers, and past growth data?
2. Is there a relationship between air quality and locations inland or on the coast to best avoid air pollution?

This project works in R to consider basic descriptive analysis using R functions and features.  Powerpoint slides offer Lessons Learned to the newbie R programmer.
